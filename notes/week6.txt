WEEK 6

This week we met to plan out our strategy for starting this project. We did research as a group into the logistics of using a database
and found that using SQLite for a simple database of courses and course data may be the best approach. We also drew out a diagram of the basic 
features of the application that will need to be implemented once our database is up and running. This included creating a list of courses that
could-be taken in general, a list of courses that could be taken the following term, and a list of possible tracks that lead to graduation.
We also planned out how data should be organized as to be most efficiently accessed.
[Subject(CIS), Course#(212), CRN, Terms offered, Prerequisites, Coursename]

Our next step as of now is to create our database of classes organized in the way we discussed, and familiarize ourselves with accessing that data.
Once we have this step up and running, we will be able to start working with that database and user inputed data to create the functionality of our project.
