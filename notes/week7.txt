This week we decided to ditch the idea of the database. Instead we have made a class for course which has members with the class details. There is now a boolean value within each class "hasTaken" which keeps track of which classes the user has taken what they still need to take. 

This weeks goals: hardcode in all the class information, research GUI's, continue writing program logic 

Task Division:

Sean: GUI Guy
Claire: HardCode in all the classes
Noah: interface for the courses
Joe: research I/O
